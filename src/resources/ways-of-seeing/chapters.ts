      'But there is also another sense in which seeing comes before words. It is seeing which establishes our place in the surrounding world; we explain that world with words, but words can never undo the fact that we are surrounded by it. The relation between what we see and what we know is never settled. Each evening we see the sun set. We know that the earth is turning away from it. Yet the knowledge, the explanation, never quite fits the sight. The Surrealist painter Magritte commented on this always-present gap between words and seeing in a painting called The Key of Dreams.',
    translate: `然而，在另一种意义上，视觉确实先于语言存在。正是视觉确立了我们在周遭世界中的位置；我们用语言解释这个世界，但语言永远无法抹去我们被世界包围这一事实。所见与所知之间的关系从未有定论。每个黄昏我们都目睹太阳西沉，明白那是地球正转离太阳。然而这份认知与解释，永远无法完全契合眼前的景象。超现实主义画家马格利特在其画作《梦的钥匙》中，就探讨了言语与视觉之间这种永恒存在的裂隙。`,

    content: `The way we see things is affected by what we know or what we believe. In the Middle Ages when men believed in the physical existence of Hell the sight of fire must have meant something different from what it means today. Nevertheless their idea of Hell owed a lot to the sight of fire consuming and the ashes remaining - as well as to their experience of the pain of burns.`,
    translate: `我们看待事物的方式受到我们所知或所信的影响。在中世纪，当人们相信地狱真实存在时，火焰的景象必然与今日有着不同的含义。然而，他们对地狱的构想很大程度上源于目睹火焰吞噬万物、余烬残留的景象——以及他们对烧伤痛苦的切身体验。`,

    content: `Yet this seeing which comes before words, and can never be quite covered by them, is not a question of mechanically reacting to stimuli. (It can only be thought of in this way if one isolates the small part of the process which concerns the eye's retina.) We only see what we look at. To look is an act of choice. As a result of this act, what we see is brought within our reach - though not necessarily within arm's reach. To touch something is to situate oneself in relation to it. (Close your eyes, move round the room and notice how the faculty of touch is like a static, limited form of sight.) We never look at just one thing; we are always looking at the relation between things and ourselves. Our vision is continually active, continually moving, continually holding things in a circle around itself, constituting what is present to us as we are.`,
    translate: `然而这种先于言语的观看，且永远无法被言语完全涵盖的视觉体验，并非机械地对刺激作出反应的问题（只有将涉及眼球视网膜的微小过程孤立出来时，才可能如此理解）。我们只看见自己注视之物。注视是一种选择行为。通过这种选择行为，所见之物便进入我们的感知范围——虽未必触手可及。触摸某物即是在确立自身与该物的关系（请闭上双眼，在室内移动并留意触觉如何如同一种静态而受限的视觉形式）。我们从不只注视单一事物；我们始终在观察事物与自身之间的关系。我们的视觉持续处于活跃状态，持续流动着，持续将万物容纳于自身周围的感知场域中，从而构建出当下呈现在我们眼前的现实世界。`,
